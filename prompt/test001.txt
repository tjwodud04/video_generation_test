The scene opens with a dark, overcast sky pouring steady rain onto a ground covered in fully bloomed hydrangeas. At the center of the frame, a man is seen from behind, kneeling quietly among the flowers. His figure is still, his posture weighed down by emotion, with raindrops trailing off his shoulders and into the sea of petals below. The atmosphere is somber, the only movement coming from the rain and the slight sway of the blossoms. The frame transitions smoothly to a new scene: a woman lies peacefully among the hydrangeas, her body gently cradled by the soft bed of flowers. Her eyes are closed, and her expression is serene. With one hand, she reaches out to softly cup the cheek of the kneeling man, who remains just barely visible—his form rendered as a faint silhouette in the dim light and falling rain. The contrast between her calm presence and his shadowed figure adds emotional weight to the moment. The final shot draws in close to the man’s face. His eyes are closed, rain streaming down his cheeks as though blending with tears. The camera lingers on this quiet, intimate moment of grief and connection, emphasizing the texture of the raindrops and the subtle tension in his expression. All scenes are rendered in an animated style—delicate yet expressive, with gentle lighting and atmospheric effects that highlight the emotional tone of the sequence.
